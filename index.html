<h2>Experience</h2>
<p>Could you imagine I made this website? There isn't a lot of experience to back it...</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I haven't taken the computer science GCSE, all i know is how to code :o</p>

    <h1>Ecommerce</h1>
    <p>My first real website! Powered by Shopify, currently. I aspire to be able to make a website for my e-commerce all by myself, as I've noticed the price point for a website powered by Shopify is pricey!</p>
    <p>The first time I encountered code in a real-life situation and was determined to know how to make it myself.</p>
    <p>Took me the 2/3 of the end of summer, still ongoing, to get started up.I've noticed the credibility of having your own domain, and the benefits it has towards web traffic. I've also discovered a new point of view on business through my experience of being a customer shopping online on websites and the contrast of being the person who builds immersive websites.</p>
    <p></p>Before this, I considered running an e-commerce on the Carrd provider, but one-page sites for an e-commerce is impossible!</p>

    <h1>Fun</h1>
    <p>My first websites were these silly little one-page pages on Carrd.</p>
    <p>I like K-pop, that's the theme of these websites!</p>
    <p>These were just for fun, but they taught me sections, and hashtags and gave me the taste of coding when I was customising text.</p>
    <p>Taught me what websites and pages actually were, and why building a web page takes ages (I spent more than 20 hours on my first page, perfecting every detail!).</p>

    <h1>Education</h1>
    <p>My education is not extensive, however, I truly don't believe that matters. I am determined to make computer science work for me!</p>
   <p> Whilst in year 11, I was hesitant to learn computer science because I felt there was a disadvantage to working in such a field that is male-dominated. But, after taking a small step into computer science, I'm ready to jump into the deep end.</p>
    <p>I started to teach myself over this summertime, through quick revision videos on GCSEpod. This worked well for me as the information was bite-size! However, this way of education didn't offer me any coding experience. But, I've picked up that A-level computer science is based more on practical coding than theory like GCSE.</p>
    <p>Sure, I don't fully understand some coding references, but I'm capable and will learn. On the way, are some computer science textbooks: </p>
